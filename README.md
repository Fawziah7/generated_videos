Features

Script Generation: Utilizes Mistral 7B (via Hugging Face Transformers) to create engaging and original scripts.

Image Generation: Employs Stable Diffusion to create visually appealing images based on generated scripts.

Audio Generation: Uses text-to-speech (TTS) to synthesize realistic narration audio.

Video Assembly: Compiles images and audio into cohesive videos using FFmpeg.
